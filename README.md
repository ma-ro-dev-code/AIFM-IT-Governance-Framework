# AIFM ICT Governance & Access Control Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a structured ICT governance framework designed for regulated AIFM environments, with focus on internal control architecture, segregation of duties, privileged access governance and operational resilience principles.

The objective is to translate supervisory expectations into implementable governance structures within fund management entities.

## Regulatory Context

The framework is aligned with:

- AIFMD risk governance principles  
- CSSF circulars on IT governance and outsourcing  
- Operational resilience requirements under DORA  
- Internal control and audit trail expectations within regulated financial institutions  

## Core Focus Areas

The framework addresses:

- ICT governance structure and accountability mapping  
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) and RACI modelling  
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) control logic  
- Superuser risk and access limitation mechanisms  
- Audit trail, logging and evidencing standards  
- Database integrity and change management controls  
- Outsourcing oversight minimum control expectations  
- Key person and concentration risk in internally developed systems

## Methodological Approach

The framework follows a structured control design methodology:

- Governance ownership allocation  
- Control objective formulation  
- Access limitation modelling  
- Audit traceability design  
- Supervisory challenge simulation  

## Status

This governance framework is under progressive and structured development.  
Additional analytical artefacts and control models will be uploaded incrementally.
