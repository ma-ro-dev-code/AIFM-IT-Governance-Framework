# AIFM ICT Governance & Access Control Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a structured governance framework addressing ICT control architecture within regulated AIFM environments.

The focus lies on segregation of duties, privileged access management, audit trail design and operational resilience principles relevant for fund structures.

## Objectives

The framework aims to:

- Define governance principles for ICT ownership and accountability  
- Establish segregation of duties (SoD) models  
- Structure privileged access management (PAM) controls  
- Define audit trail and logging expectations  
- Address key person and operational resilience risks  
- Map outsourcing oversight minimum requirements
